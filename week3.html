                “ 'AI Slop' Distorting Our Reality: The World Is Sleepwalking into Disaster" by Nesrine Malik really made me realize
                how crazy and overwhelming the internet has become. When I open social media, I see news about politics, war,
                and natural disasters right next to AI slop memes and randomly generated images. It is such a strange contrast.
                One second, I am looking at footage of something serious happening in the world, and the next second, I am seeing
                a completely fake AI image that seems almost believable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Malik discusses how AI is being used politically, especially by Trump and other Republicans, and I immediately thought
                of all the crazy political AI images Republicans create on X. I remember Donald Trump Jr. posting an AI-generated photo
                of Donald Trump riding on top of a giant cat with an army of cats behind him while holding an AK-47. He captioned it
                “Save our pets!!!!!!” as a reference to Donald Trump’s claim that illegal immigrants were eating cats and dogs. It was
                bizarre on so many levels, and I could not even believe that a political figure actually posted that. The image looked
                dramatic and ridiculous, but it gained so much attention. Republicans often use AI to create images that fit their own
                perception of the world and their opinions, even when their views are entirely disconnected from actual reality. Instead
                of backing their claims with objective evidence, they create exaggerated AI fantasies to convince their audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fake images are incredibly damaging because they spread misinformation so easily. Many older people, and those who are
                not as familiar with AI technology, might take what they see online as real. If something looks realistic enough, it
                becomes believable. Sometimes these images are shared in spaces like family group chats, and they gain even more
                credibility. False AI slop images spread rapidly.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also think about how AI contributes to desensitization. I think of how the Epstein files revealed horrific details
                about abuse and exploitation that many victims, who were mainly children, faced. Even though the content in those files
                is absolutely disgusting, I saw AI-generated memes about the situation. Turning something that serious into meme content
                minimizes the severity of what happened. It makes people treat it like entertainment instead of a serious issue that
                requires punishment for the perpetrators and justice for the victims.
            </p>

            <p>
                It all comes down to how AI content is designed to generate clicks. Social media platforms reward engagement, not
                accuracy, so the more shocking and dramatic something is, the more attention it gets. AI makes it easy to produce this
                type of content quickly and cheaply since it does not require real labor or even real events.
            </p>

            <p>
                The problem is that when real images of violence or political issues appear alongside AI-generated content, everything
                starts to blend together. Violence and tragedy become just another post when you are overwhelmed with content all the
                time. It is overstimulating, and as a result, people have become extremely desensitized to issues that require urgency
                and attention.
