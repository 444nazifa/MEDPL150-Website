            Susan Sontag’s <em>In Plato’s Cave</em> made me think more deeply about how casually I interact with images on a daily basis. Taking photos is extremely common, especially because of phones and social media, and it’s easy to forget that images are not neutral or meaningless. We take pictures without thinking much about them, but Sontag argues that photographs actually shape how we understand reality rather than simply recording it. Images influence what we pay attention to and how we interpret events, even when we don’t realize it. This idea stood out to me because I rarely questioned the power images have over my perception of the world prior to this reading.

            One point Sontag makes that really impacted me is that photography always involves choice. Photographers decide where to stand, what angle to use, when to take the photo, and what details to include or leave out. These decisions reflect their personal values, tastes, and beliefs, even if it is unintentional. Before this reading, I didn’t think much about how a photographer’s bias could impact an image. I often assumed that photos showed the truth, but now I understand that every photograph carries meaning, whether it’s intentional or not. Another interesting idea in the reading is how photography can encourage non-intervention when people photograph suffering. Sontag explains that taking photos can create emotional distance and turn real pain into something people can observe rather than respond to. Photographers sometimes choose to document suffering for attention or personal gain rather than taking actions to help. Sontag also discusses how being constantly exposed to images of violence and tragedy can make people feel numb, since shock eventually becomes familiar. This made me reflect on how many scary images I see online every day, and how I simply scroll past them because it has become so normal to see disturbing images on social media.

            Before reading <em>In Plato’s Cave</em>, photography mostly meant capturing moments I wanted to remember. I took photos of important people, events, and moments that felt meaningful to me. Photography was also a way for me to share my life on social media and stay connected with friends and family. Sending photos felt more personal than just texting because it allowed people to visually see what I was experiencing during the activity I was doing. I never really questioned this habit or thought about how images could affect how others perceive my life. After reading this essay, the way I think about photography has changed. I now want to take photos with intention and meaning instead of doing it automatically. I also view images differently and think more critically about what they are showing and their purpose. In this class, I want to start creating work that is more intentional and thoughtful, rather than taking photos of things that I think look cool or visually appealing. I want to be more aware of how my choices as a photographer affect the meaning of an image and how it will be interpreted by others.
